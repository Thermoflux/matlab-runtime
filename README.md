# matlab-runtime
MATLAB runtime for Linux

This docker file will configure an environment into which the Matlab compiler
runtime will be installed and in which stand-alone matlab routines (such as
those created with Matlab's deploytool) can be executed.

See http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/ for more info.
